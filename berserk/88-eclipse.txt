As Griffith kneels in the water in the light of the setting sun, he stares at his beherit, which is hanging from his outstretched hand. He recalls Zodd's prophecy of a treasured belonging returning to him, and also thinks of Wyald's plea to call the God Hand using it. Just then, a breeze begins to blow over the river.

As Guts chases after Griffith in his own cart, he begins to wonder whether it really is a good idea to leave the Band of the Falcon again. He thinks back to his duel against Griffith outside Wyndham and begins to blame himself for Griffith's condition.

The rest of the band is not far behind Guts, running on horseback to reach Griffith. All at once, the band, Guts and Griffith notice an odd phenomenon happening in the sky; a black circle slowly encroaching upon the sun: a solar eclipse. The blood from Griffith's neck has slowly run down his arm and made contact with his beherit, which begins to open its eyes.

Griffith hears Guts' voice as the latter calls out to him. Griffith tries to distance himself from Guts. Verbally, he only manages loud grunts and screams. Mentally, Griffith is yelling at Guts not to approach. Just then, Guts notices, behind Griffith, many silhouettes of naked men and women all along the river. Casca suspects they're of Midland's army, but they all have an inhuman quality about them in their builds and features.

Guts calls out to Griffith again, who keeps mentally pleading for Guts to stay away, and not to touch him.

Guts jumps from the cart and runs into the water, despite Griffith's mental pleas. He gets closer and closer, and finally grabs Griffith's shoulder.

With that, the beherit's facial features rearrange, and it begins to cry tears of blood. In a silent scream, it transports the Band of the Falcon to what seems to be a different dimension; a place where the sky is made up of humanoid specters and the ground is a hilly landscape of enormous faces.

The Eclipse has begun.
