Together, the God Hand, Void, Conrad, Ubik and Slan welcome the fifth and final member among their ranks: Femto.

Griffith does not resemble his former self. His body is now one big black piece of flesh, carved to resemble that of a very muscular man. A pair of dark, leathery wings protrude from his shoulders. The only indication that the being is Griffith is the shape of its helmet-like exoskeleton, which is identical to Griffith's old hawk helmet. His face is barely visible beneath it but it is unmistakable, aside from deep red lips and inhuman eyes.

In the deathly silence, Griffith opens his wings to their maximum span, flaps them once, and floats ominously down off the giant hand, landing a few feet away from the trapped Guts. The apostles surround Guts and the new God Hand in complete silence, having ceased all attempts to kill or eat Guts. Griffith stretches one arm out horizontally, inviting the body of the only other living member of the Band of the Falcon next to him, a barely conscious body, which is suspended in the air by one of the nearby apostles: Casca.

Guts watches in horror, unable to move, as Griffith begins to violate and rape her. Every step Griffith advances in his taking advantage of her sends waves of rage through Guts. After a few seconds of watching, Guts strikes at the teeth of the apostle which are keeping his arm trapped, but in vain; his sword breaks after a few hits.

After a moment's hesitation, Guts, using the broken blade, begins the process of violently hacking at his own arm in order to free himself, something which spurns the interest of the God Hand.

Upon freeing himself, the wounded and maimed Guts turns the broken sword on Griffith.
