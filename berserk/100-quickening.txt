Pippin's lifeless body is torn in half at the waist by a slug-like apostle. It throws both halves away before charging at Guts, jaws wide open. Guts jumps out of the way in the nick of time, but falls back-first down the hill. When he stands up, he is completely surrounded by apostles, an impossible number to beat. They all show off the bodies of the Band of the Falcon members they've killed, holding entire bodies above their heads, heads in their mouths, and wearing their faces like masks.

Seeing the horror before him makes Guts go berserk, screaming in anger. He then notices, high above him, another body - Casca's.

Seeing her held up naked and possibly dead multiplies Guts' rage many-fold. He charges forward, cutting down every apostle in his path in a furious and desperate attempt to reach her. His warpath is cut short when an apostle bites down on Guts' left forearm. Before the apostles can begin to further abuse Casca in front of Guts, a loud heartbeat is heard, drawing all their attention to the giant hand in the middle of the chaos. Griffith's metamorphosis is complete.
