Guts tells the group to stay close behind him, then begins a furious mission to clear a path to the top of the prison. On the narrow staircase, the guards cannot swarm the group, and Guts can simply kill one man after the next.

Guts loses himself in a silent fury, using the bodies of men he's just killed to shield himself from the occasional volley of arrows fired from further up the stairs. In no time, he's killed all the soldiers present.

Casca orders the large and strong Pippin to carry Griffith up the stairs as the rescue team makes their long climb up and out of the prison. Just outside the entrance to the Tower of Rebirth, another contingent of guards is waiting to intercept them. With a force like an explosion, the door of the tower explodes, and several dead guards fly out of the door frame, swiftly followed by Guts, who is covered in blood, but not his own.

Guts is dangerously out of breath, and the captain of the guards orders him surrounded. With barely a moment's pause, Guts continues his savage onslaught. Casca, Charlotte, Judeau and Pippin, carrying Griffith, follow close behind.

They are nearly pelted by a hail of arrows, but the king of Midland, who appears to have aged considerably since his assault of Charlotte, orders his guards not to fire, fearing for his daughter's safety. The king notices Griffith on Pippin's back, and collapses out of anger, seeing that Griffith and Charlotte are running away together.

The king then orders the summoning of the Bakiraka.
