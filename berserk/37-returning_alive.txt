Casca has been saved, but Guts' fight still rages on. He has killed dozens of soldiers, and there are still as many left. He wonders why he's risking his life in the dark forest against an impossible opponent even after Casca has long since escaped, yet he continues to swing his sword. He suspects the battle will last until morning.

Casca runs to Judeau and, exhausted, collapses into his arms. She has not forgotten about Guts, and she leads the Band of the Falcon to his location in an effort to save him.

Casca, Judeau and other band members arrive at daybreak and find the countless bodies of Adon's soldiers. As Judeau stands utterly dumbfounded that Guts managed to kill so many men, Casca notices Guts leaning against a tree, yet another arrow protruding from his shoulder. Fearing the worst, Casca runs to him and shakes him awake. His calm yet sarcastic reaction that she'll worsen his wounds reassures the mercenaries, especially Casca.

Guts is brought back into their camp via stretcher, and he is tended to by their medic, who informs him that he'll be out of commission for most, if not all, of the rest of the campaign. Guts' refusal to give up and urge to continue fighting angers the medic and worries Casca, though she remains relieved that Guts is safe. Griffith is not present due to his having to attend a war council.

Later in the night, the band celebrates Guts and Casca's return. She converses with some soldiers but is pulled away by Judeau, who explains that when Griffith was informed of their falling off the cliff, he ordered a search party be organized despite the opposition of various nobles, claiming instead that Guts and Casca were vital to the Band of the Falcon.

Casca is touched by Griffith's concern for her, and Judeau gifts Casca a bag of elf dust, provided by an elf Judeau met during his days as a traveling entertainer.

Casca runs to look for Guts, who she finds sitting atop a hill, looking over the band's encampment.
