Judeau is tasked by Casca to relight the lantern. Pippin urgently stops him from doing so when the entire group begins to smell something odd. Further down the tunnel, the female Bakiraka, draped only in brass bracelets and bags full of dust, ignites a spark using the former items to cause an explosion in the tunnel. The rescue team runs for their lives, but the fiery air quickly closes in. Suddenly, Griffith glances upward, noticing a small column of light coming from the ceiling. Griffith's movement alerts Pippin to the light, and he uses his hammer to smash a large hole into the ceiling, which leads outside. The explosion is sucked out of the escape tunnel and into the open air, saving them. The group, now close to the graveyard exit, hastens to leave.

Later, the female Bakiraka is executed by the King of Midland for her failure in killing Griffith and letting Charlotte get hurt. The King then assumed Anna cooperated with Charlotte, but the latter states she forced the handmaid to be part of it and asks the King to forgive Anna. His understanding fa√ßade changes when Chalotte then asks the King to let Griffith escape, having suffered enough during his year-long imprisonment. The King, after a moment of silence, acquiesces to her request. She is then taken to the palace.

Unbeknownst to Charlotte or Anna, the King has no plans to let Griffith, or the rest of the Band of the Falcon, escape with their lives. He orders his guards to unleash the Black Dog Knights upon the Band of the Falcon. The guards then pay a visit to the Knights. Wyald, a beast-like man and the Black Dogs' leader, is seen having sex with a woman until he is interrupted by one of the Knights, who tells them they have direct orders of the King to move. Wyald refuses, stating that he has business to take care of that day. When the man mentions that Griffith is their target, Wyald accepts the mission and kills the woman, as the White Falcon was that "business" he had to take care of.
