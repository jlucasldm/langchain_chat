Zodd advances on Guts, complimenting the raid captain's skills with his sword, which has been upgraded yet again during Guts' three years in the Band of the Falcon. Guts manages to block blows strong enough to destroy some nearby pillars, but Zodd maintains the upper hand.

Knowing he has no chance in a one-on-one fight, Guts prepares to strike Zodd with a single full-force blow, which Zodd intends to match. Both men swing, and Guts cuts the top half of Zodd's blade clean off, but the warrior has the wherewithal to block the follow-through with his bare arms.

Zodd again commends Guts, this time for being the first person to ever cut him so deeply. Despite the strike being strong enough to kill any normal man, Zodd simply grabs the blade bare-handed, raises it out of his wounds, and begins his transformation into an enormous, horned lion-like humanoid being.
