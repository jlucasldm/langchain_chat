As the Band of the Falcon members tend to Charlotte, Guts manages to chop the tiny Bakiraka in half. The lanky man reappears, and offers the group an exchange: they are to hand Charlotte over, and in return the Bakiraka will guarantee her life is spared. Casca authorizes the trade, and Anna brings Charlotte over to the Bakiraka. Charlotte reaches for Griffith before she leaves, and he mouths something only she can hear, which reassures her.

With Charlotte out of harm's way, the Bakiraka proceed to go all-out with their assassination attempt. Pippin notices the stout assassin emerge from the water, and blocks a blow intended for Griffith. The group forms a protective barrier around Griffith and fend off attacks from the lanky man.

The enormous, muscular Bakiraka throws a javelin at the group from a distance, which Guts deflects, but the force of the throw sends the javelin ricocheting multiple times down the length of the tunnel. Another is thrown, and Guts deflects it again. Judeau notices how the weapon sends up sparks whenever it hits the walls.

Coming up with an idea, Judeau orders the detachment's torch be extinguished, and tells Pippin to wait for his signal. Judeau throws a couple knives at the walls in the direction the javelins were thrown from, and the light created by the sparks allows him to catch a glimpse of the enormous Bakiraka.

Judeau manages to send two knives into his neck, killing him.

Judeau signals Pippin, who smashes the wall as hard as he can with his hammer. The result is a quick emission of light caused by the sparks which allows the group to see and kill the remaining Bakiraka.
