Since joining the Band of the Falcon, Guts has been promoted to raid captain and has scores of mercenaries under his command.

Griffith, Casca, Corkus, Rickert, Judeau and all their subordinates look on as, in the distance, Guts leads his own men to raid a castle occupied by Tudor forces. Judeau informs those around him that a legendary swordsman and fearsome warrior known as Zodd is purportedly allied with Tudor. Legends involving Zodd are centuries old, hence both his nickname, Nosferatu, and the notion that he is immortal. They all have the same feeling of unease upon learning the news.

Inside the castle proper, Guts is raring to enter a keep in which he sent fifty men who have not returned, having been killed by a single warrior inside. Despite Gaston's (Guts' second-in-command) suggestion, Guts refuses to ask for reinforcements from Griffith. Suddenly, a lone band member exits the keep, the right side of his body horrifically mangled. He utters the name "Nosferatu Zodd" before dying, confirming the earlier rumors.

Ordering his men to wait outside, Guts enters the keep alone.

As Guts wanders through the keep, he sees the bodies of his soldiers have been completely torn apart, despite their wearing armor. As he ventures deeper, he finds Zodd; a hulking, naked man with animalistic characteristics who wields only an enormous cutlass-like blade. Guts charges, but is easily knocked back by the larger and stronger Zodd, who seems practically inhuman.
