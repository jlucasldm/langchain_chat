Casca's raiding of Doldrey is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Adon, clad in shark-themed armor. Due to his loss of command, all his soldiers have been stationed within Doldrey, and so he assumes responsibility for Doldrey's protection. Hell-bent on avenging the death of his brother, Samson, Adon prepares to duel Casca.

On the battlefield, Gennon is informed that despite all their best attempts, his soldiers cannot reach Griffith due to a single man blocking their path: Guts. Boscogn steps in to face Guts personally, and the clash of their weapons is too fast to be perceived by the soldiers watching them.

Casca, who is no longer suffering the effects of her period, is easily able to get the better of Adon in battle, sending him falling down a flight of stairs.

Back near the river, Rickert is saved from death by the timely intervention of Pippin. They, along with Corkus, have begun to feel that the fight is hopeless, what with the Band of the Falcon being massively outnumbered. Griffith has stopped fighting to watch Guts' fierce battle against Boscogn. Guts remarks that he feels worse than he did while fighting Adon's hundred men and is reminded of his fight against Zodd, but he decides that the current situation is far less hopeless as the previous two were.

Back in Doldrey, Casca lays into Adon, fighting so furiously he can't even block. During a lull in her attacks, he takes the opportunity to kneel in submission and beg for forgiveness. Casca is bewildered at his ridiculous performance, and he takes advantage of her confusion by shooting her in the shoulder with his crossbow.
