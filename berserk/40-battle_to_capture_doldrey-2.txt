The Band of the Falcon is in position before Doldrey. In the pre-battle stillness, Judeau and Guts make conversation. Thanks to Judeau's elf dust, Guts' injuries have almost completely healed. Judeau can't help but marvel at the enormous structure that is Doldrey - enormous, thick walls and a towering inner keep, but Guts is confident that if Griffith has a plan, they will emerge victorious.

Boscogn has assembled his Holy Purple Rhino Knights outside Doldrey in anticipation of the imminent charge. He doesn't think too highly of Griffith's decision to place his band between Boscogn's forces and a river, leaving them with nowhere to run. Boscogn wonders whether there is a connection between Griffith and Gennon, but doesn't ponder the matter for too long, choosing instead to defeat the enemy regardless of Griffith's potental death.

Inside Doldrey, Gennon cannot stop thinking of Griffith, and considers himself lucky that he will get to meet the White Falcon yet again. His obsession hinges on his lust for Griffith.

Guts can barely see Doldrey through a dust storm that has cropped up, but he is reassured by Griffith, who maintains that everything is going according to plan. Griffith moves ahead to assume command. Guts looks back at the flag flying the Band of the Falcon's colors, considering that this deciding battle may be the last one he fights with the band. Griffith orders the charge, and Guts lowers his visor, determined not to let his emotions get the better of him during the battle.

Boscogn is confused by the band splitting their already tiny force into two, but isn't dismayed. The first half of the forces charge directly through the Holy Purple Rhino Knights, led by Guts, who has no trouble cutting through anyone in his way.
