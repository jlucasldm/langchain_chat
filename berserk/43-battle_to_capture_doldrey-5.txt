Guts finds himself in a dire situation. His blade has been snapped in two and he's been knocked off his horse. Soldiers of both sides of the battle have stopped to watch his fight against Boscogn. On a distant cliff overlooking the battlefield, a mysterious swordsman sits atop his horse and also watches the duel.

Within Doldrey's walls, Casca is struggling to stay awake thanks to a toxin placed on the tips of Adon's arrows. She manages to dodge his attacks, but only just; one of his spear thrusts is able to knock her helmet off. Eventually, Adon is able to corner her against the inside of Doldrey's outer wall. Quickly improvising a plan, she dodges what would have been the killing blow by using her sword to vault over Adon's spear. She flips over him, and upon landing, throws one quick slash across Adon's face, slicing his cheeks open and widening his mouth. In a combination of shock and blood loss, Adon collapses, dead. Casca orders the soldiers who watched their battle to continue the raid.

Boscogn prepares to charge against the isolated and injured Guts. Several Band of the Falcon members attempt to intercept Boscogn's attack, but he cuts them down with no loss of momentum. All is seemingly lost, until the horseman on the distant cliff throws his sword - an enormous cleaver-like blade - across the impossible distance so that it lands directly in front of Guts, surprising every soldier present. Griffith is the first to come to his senses and yells for Guts to wield the weapon. He does so, and Guts manages to block Boscogn's charge with his new sword. In one powerful swing, Guts takes off Boscogn's head, and also that of his horse.

Tudor's army, with the exception of Gennon, suffers a massive loss of morale. Gennon orders them to fight, but their spirits are broken more once they notice that the Band of the Falcon has also taken Doldrey.
