Guts charges full-force against Boscogn, who steels himself. The resulting clash results in the loss of Guts' helmet and the severing of the ornamental horns on Boscogn's. The respective commanders' soldiers join the fray.

Up within Doldrey, Gennon has noticed the ferocity with which Boscogn is fighting. Worried that he will kill Griffith, accidentally or not, Gennon orders for his bodyguards to be armed and ride out with him. He intends to personally take command of his forces to ensure that Griffith remains alive.

Back outside, Griffith orders the Band of the Falcon to fall back to their headquarters, though the look on Guts' face reveals a hidden logic in this maneuver besides the obvious escape from the enemy. Boscogn is suspicious of the reasons behind their retreat, but his fellow soldiers long to give chase. Gennon, who has joined the battle, orders their pursuit, despite Boscogn's misgivings.

Noticing that the Purple Rhino Knights have given chase, Griffith orders the Band of the Falcon to stop and take formation along the river. Meanwhile, Casca, hidden in the dust which floats around the river, orders the other half of the band to form up. Tudor's men at Doldrey cannot perceive anything through the thick dust cloud.

With Boscogn's knights preoccupied far from the castle, Casca orders her troops through the massive doors into the impenetrable Doldrey. She orders her men to take Doldrey as quickly as possible, and sets up a contingent of soldiers to prevent word getting to Boscogn that Doldrey has been invaded.

Adon, relieved of command, watches Casca from a window high up in Doldrey.
