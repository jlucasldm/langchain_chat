The Band of the Falcon has gained the advantage over the Black Dog Knights. One of the latter calls out to Wyald, informing him that the Black Dogs intend to retreat, but Wyald is far too engaged in his battle with Guts to consider leaving. In one quick move, and with just one hand, Wyald tears an enormous hole into a tree's trunk, then punches the newly-created weak spot. The resulting damage to the tree causes it to collapse on the retreating Black Dog Knights, killing them.

Wyald is having so much fun fighting Guts that he takes it upon himself to escalate it. He casts his club away (into the face of a Black Dog Knight) and begins transforming, to the Band of the Falcon's surprise and horror. He grows to be taller than three times Guts' height. His lower body is consumed by that of what appears to be a headless gorilla's, with Wyald's top half acting as the head. The gorilla body has a large mouth just above its pectorals, and has three eyes; one on each shoulder, and a vertically-oriented one going up Wyald's abdomen. Guts notes the similarities in Wyald and Zodd's transformations.

Wyald, in his new monstrous body, grabs an entire tree and uproots it, using it to swipe at Guts, who is sent flying into the forest's canopy before crashing down to the ground, unconscious.

Wyald then advances on Casca, making special note that she is the only woman among the male-dominated Band of the Falcon. Before he can grab her, however, a volley of arrows, shot by troops led by Judeau, flies into his body, which has no effect beyond irritating him. He plucks them out before brandishing his tree at them.
