Griffith collapses in the shallow ravine, and the Band of the Falcon rushes over. As Casca attends to Griffith, Guts interrogates Charlotte. When she cannot answer his questions, a frustrated Guts searches the thickly forested surroundings, but he doesn't spot Julius' assassin hiding behind a tree.

Everyone's attention is drawn back to Griffith, who tells everyone to remain calm. He extracts the bolt and discovers that it has been covered in poison. Griffith then reveals that his heart was shielded by his Beherit, and thus he is completely unharmed. The band members all marvel at Griffith's amazing luck, but Guts suspects something greater than luck is responsible for Griffith's survival. Charlotte, dismounted from her horse, apologizes to Griffith for having drawn him to the secluded ravine. The band menbers suddenly realize that Charlotte may have been the assailant's target, and Guts takes a group of men to search the forest, but the crossbowman has already left the area. Meanwhile, Griffith has caught sight of Julius, and he intuitively learns his would-be assassin's identity.

Back at Wyndham, Julius and the crossbowman discuss their failed plan in Julius' lounge. The prevailing theory behind the attack among the nobles is that a Tudor assassin was sent to kill Charlotte, and Griffith protected her with his own body. Julius, furious that his plan backfired and raised Griffith's status among Midland's aristocracy, orders his co-conspirator to leave. Julius thinks back on his and Griffith's locking eyes in the hunting grounds: he likens Griffith's gaze to a falcon eyeing its prey.

Elsewhere in Wyndham, Guts responds to Griffith's summons. He finds him in a study high up in a tower, where Griffith claims that winning battles alone cannot earn him high enough status to get his own kingdom. As Griffith writes and places his seal on a letter, he proposes he and Guts come up with their own assassination plot.
