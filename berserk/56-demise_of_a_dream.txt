Charlotte's scream surprises the king, who backs away from her. He is briefly apologetic before his lust quickly takes over again. He climbs over her, restrains her wrists, and tries to force her legs apart, an act which earns him a kick in the face from his daughter. With the sudden injury to his eye causing debilitation, he runs from Charlotte's room, blaming Griffith for the acts he's just committed. At the same moment, Charlotte collapses on her bed, pleading for Griffith to save her.

The Band of the Falcon have left Wyndham and are waiting in a field on horseback. They've been fooled into thinking that they've been ordered there by Griffith. The distant sound of hoofbeats makes itself heard, and Pippin, the first to realize what's happening, yells for everyone to run. A hail of arrows pelts the mercenaries, killing some and injuring others. They are soon surrounded by many cavalries, and they all realize that these horsemen are from Midland. Casca takes command and orders the band to form ranks.

In the dungeon, Griffith is in the middle of being tortured by the deformed man. He receives the torturer's praise for not having made any noise while being brutalized. The torturer suddenly notices the beherit around Griffith's neck. He plucks it from Griffith's skin and stares at the odd ornament. It opens its eyes, surprising the torturer, who drops it.

The beherit falls through a grate and into a sewer below Wyndham, and Griffith watches as it floats away.
