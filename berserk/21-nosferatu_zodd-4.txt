Guts and Griffith dart around either side of the giant Zodd, who doesn't know where to turn first. Consequently, Griffith is able to slice his arm off. Zodd angrily swipes at Griffith with his tail, and the impact of the blow knocks Griffith out. He then clubs Guts with his own severed arm, before placing it back on his stump, where it reattaches with a burst of steam.

Zodd rounds on the still-unconscious Griffith to kill first, calling it a shame after finding another who can actually harm him. But Zodd stops in his tracks when he takes notice of the crimson Beherit around Griffith's neck. The shock of seeing it sends a wave of fear through Zodd, the feeling then becoming one of amusement over this being part of their design. Zodd punches through the roof of the keep while sprouting bat-like wings, giving Guts a prophecy: that if he is a true friend to Griffith, then he shall die an unavoidable death at the time when Griffith's dream has been shattered. Zodd proceeds to burst his way out of the keep and flies off, Guts pondering the demon's words before making his way toward Griffith as he is tended to by Casca. The latter tells Guts to stay away, blaming him for Griffith's injuries.
