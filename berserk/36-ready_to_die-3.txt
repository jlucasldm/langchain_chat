Guts urges Casca to leave. With her path cleared, she decides to run, but she promises to return with Griffith and the Band of the Falcon to rescue Guts. Guts blocks the soldiers from chasing after her, killing anyone who tries to get around him to reach her. The soldiers distance themselves from him, coming to the realization that Guts is too strong a foe for them to face. Adon urges them to fight, but the soldiers are hesitant. After some deliberation, they decide to attack all at once. Guts eagerly meets them head-on.

As she runs through the forest, Casca trips over a protruding root. She then notices there are soldiers giving chase behind her. She raises her sword, but she cannot fight for long due to her pain and fever, so she continues to run. Meanwhile, Guts continues to fight Adon's soldiers. He is easily able to slice through their large numbers. Eventually, a crossbow bolt is fired at his face, but he blocks it with his bare hand. This new handicap prevents him from wielding his enormous sword two-handed, as intended in its use.

The soldiers chasing Casca have caught up once again. Despite her attempts to fight back, they manage to knock her down and disarm her. The soldiers decide they want to violate her before killing her and begin the process of removing her armor and tearing her tunic open. She curses her own helplessness and remembers her earlier conversation with Guts, who told her to return to Griffith. Snapping out of her reverie, she feels for a broken tree branch on the ground and uses it to stab the soldier pinning her down in the eye.

Suddenly liberated, Casca dives for her sword. Her self-rescue is cut short by Judeau and a large group of band members, who've come to rescue her and Guts.
