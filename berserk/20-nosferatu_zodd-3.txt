The monster that Zodd has become attacks Guts with his bare hands, but Guts is overcome with fear and doesn't notice the strike until it's too late. The blow lands, sending Guts straight through a nearby pillar. Having come to his senses, Guts moves with all his strength to avoid Zodd's attacks as the monster demands him to fight back. Finding an opening, Guts strikes, but it's futile: Guts' sword barely manages a scratch on Zodd's horns. Zodd strikes again, and Guts is knocked into another pillar. With Guts now too tired and injured to move, Zodd expresses disappointment in the short fight yet compliments the young warrior one last time for his tenacity and skill.

Before Zodd can deal the killing blow, a volley of arrows dig into his back: Griffith has arrived with the Band of the Falcon, intent on saving Guts. They fire a second volley, but the arrows have no effect as a livid Zodd proceeds to massacre his new opponents for interfering in his battle. While the monster is distracted, Griffith takes the opportunity to find Guts and help him escape, the latter angry at himself for needing to be saved by Griffith. But Zodd steps before them as they were about to fall back, not intending to let them leave the chamber alive.
