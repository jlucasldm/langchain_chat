Holding the tree horizontally, Wyald uses it to plow through Judeau's archers. He takes advantage of their disorganization and fear by rampaging and eating them with his new, giant mouth.

Judeau orders the Band of the Falcon to retreat, the battle having become undeniably one-sided. As Griffith's medics lift him out of the hole beneath the tree to prepare for his departure, he notices, in the distance, Casca crying over Guts' unconscious body and desperately trying to wake him. Her fears are realized when Wyald focuses on them and advances. Now with nobody to defend her, Wyald relishes in the moment. He picks Casca up in his enormous hand and uses the other to remove her armor, then her tunic. Using his stomach tongue, which is the transformed equivalent of his penis, he removes her trousers and threatens to take advantage of her. Casca is saved when Guts wakes and drives the point of his sword through Wyald's tongue and slices it off.

Guts takes advantage of the stunned Wyald to slice deeply into his arm, the pain making Wyald release his grip on Casca. She takes up her sword, but Guts tells her to leave, citing two reasons. His first, sarcastic reason is that her being nearly naked around him will prove too distracting; the second, more serious reason is that he has a personal vendetta against "them" and he wants to deal with them all personally.
