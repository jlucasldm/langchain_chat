Now free, but lacking an arm, Guts charges toward Griffith, complete and total wrath radiating from his body. His advance is cut short by several Apostles, who stop and pin Guts to the ground. He can only watch as Griffith has his way with Casca.

Guts stares at the scene before him, feeling both horror and rage. He struggles violently, but he cannot free himself from beneath the Apostles that have pinned him down. Griffith's eyes are fixed only on either Guts' or Casca.

Casca, who had been quiet up to this point but for saying "no" occasionally and breathing heavily, begs Guts not to look at what is being done to her. But Guts remains transfixed until the very end, when the rape finally ends with Griffith's ejaculation and his casting Casca's body to the ground. The last thing Guts sees with his right eye before it is punctured by an Apostle's claw is the sight of his lover, motionless on the ground. He howls with rage and agony.

Suddenly, the solar eclipse above the entire scene seems to crack, drawing the attention of the God Hand and the Apostles. In an instant, the black circle explodes altogether, and the Skull Knight, mounted on his horse, swoops down from the hole in the sky. As his horse runs down through the air, the Skull Knight aims a single sword strike at Void, who conjures a portal which absorbs the blow and sends it back at the Skull Knight. The Skull Knight blocks his own attack.
