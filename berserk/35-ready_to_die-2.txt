The real fight begins, and Adon orders his men to gang up on Guts and Casca, rather than attack one at a time. Guts, thanks to his big sword and immense strength, is able to easily swipe right through opponents and kill more than one per swing. Meanwhile, the smaller and more agile Casca jumps quickly from one opponent to another, quickly killing them as she goes.

Guts and Casca are able to maneuver themselves back to each other, and Adon calls his brother Samson to fight. Despite being the younger of the pair, Samson is nearly twice Adon's size, who is already about twice the size of a normal man. Armed with a massive flail, Samson swings wildly at Guts, whose enormous sword allows him to deflect the iron ball rather than needing to dodge it. Guts and Samson's fight escalates, and they both increase the speed of their attacks.

As Casca wonders why Guts deflects the blow rather than evade, she comes to realize that he's doing it to protect her rather than himself. She then notices blood leaking from beneath his armor, and Adon points out the arrow wound he inflicted on Guts has reopened.

Between Samson's attacks, Guts tells Casca that he's going to clear a path through which she can escape Adon's soldiers. Samson attacks again, but this time, Guts doesn't deflect the flail, and instead completely shatters it. He uses the opportunity to kill the surprised Samson. With him out of the way, and Casca's path cleared, Guts tells her to leave, but she refuses. Suddenly alerted to their plan, Adon orders his crossbowmen fire at Casca. They do so, but Guts runs into the arrows' path and uses his armor to block them, though his bare arm is pierced.

As Guts removes the arrow, he tells Casca not to get the wrong idea, and that he merely took the blow so that she could return to Griffith and be at his side. Casca watches as Guts prepares to fight the rest of Adon's forces alone.
