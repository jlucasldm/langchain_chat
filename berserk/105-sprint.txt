Small animals and plants are disturbed from their peaceful existences by moving brush and loud screams. Guts yanks off the bandaging on his face, yelling as he runs.

Guts sprints through the forest he finds himself in. He has no clear destination and barely focuses on his surroundings; his mind clouded by the images of Band of the Falcon members. He thinks first of Judeau, and their conversation on Guts' first night with the band. His mind moves to Corkus, and his perpetual scowl and apparent dislike of Guts. Then the stoic, ever-silent Pippin. Next is Gaston and the raiders with their adoration for their commander. Casca and the band he considered family. Finally, he thinks of Griffith.

As Guts runs, he leaps wide chasms, falls from cliffs, and is grazed by tree branches, all of which remove his bandaging and reopen his wounds. He pays them no mind, running on and on, crying and yelling, until night falls, and at last he collapses to his knees from exhaustion in a grassy field. Guts stares up into the night sky as it begins to rain. He sees the image of Femto, Griffith's new form and identity, above him.

He continues to stare until he feels a sharp pain in his neck, forcing him into a sitting position. The Brand on his neck has begun to bleed, seemingly without provocation. He then hears whispers and murmurs from the rustling grass. Guts stands to face his opponents, small, translucent things barely the height of the grass. The appearance of a much larger being behind him makes Guts turn.

It's the Skull Knight, and he tells Guts that he now exists in a world that is neither completely new nor completely familiar; Guts resides in the Interstice, the boundary where the mortal plane meets that of the dead.
