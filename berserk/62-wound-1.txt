Guts and Casca have moved away from the cliff to a nearby tree, the roots of which are cushioned with moss. Both are naked, and Guts is positioned above Casca. He notices her trembling, and Casca wonders whether she'll change by going ahead with Guts.

Guts looks down her body and notices the scars caused by the puncture wounds she received when the Band of the Falcon was attacked by Midland's forces. She covers her body, worried that he won't like her as a woman due to them. Guts reassures her, and he says that if she spends too much time focused on the dead or broken, she'll find death perched on her shoulder. He pulls her into a hug, and Casca senses that her feelings for Guts aren't lies.

They begin having sex in silence. Due to this, he doesn't realize how roughly he's treating her until Casca asks him to be gentler. When Casca begins to cry out, Guts suddenly has visions of his younger self being taken advantage of by Donovan. He moves away from Casca, who calls him. Guts doesn't speak. Rather, he stretches his hands out and wraps them around what he perceives to be his younger self's neck. In reality, the neck he's grasping onto is Casca's.
